<p>Manchester United left manager Sir Alex Ferguson emotional on Saturday night by naming a stand after him to celebrate his 25 years at the club.
Chief executive David Gill revealed the surprise tribute as he stood on the Old Trafford pitch with Sir Alex before the kick-off.
And there was thunderous applause from the 76,000 fans when workmen pulled away a cover on top of the north stand to uncover in big red letters ‘Sir Alex Ferguson Stand’.</p>

<p>‘I didn’t expect it and I didn’t know a thing about it,’ admitted Ferguson. ‘It made me feel really emotional and honoured to see my name on the stand. I think [assistant manager] Mike Phelan knew what was going to happen, so he is sacked!’
The Scot, who took over the reins on November 6, 1986, walked out for the Barclays Premier League game against Sunderland through a guard of honour made up of both teams and Black Cats boss Steve Bruce, who played under Ferguson for nine years.
As the stadium stood to applaud the 69-year-old, the covers were taken off the new sign bearing the words Sir Alex Ferguson Stand, before the United boss addressed the fans and declared his pride at working for 'the best club in the world'. 
The club will also commission a statue of the manager to go outside the stand named after him. It is expected to be unveiled before start of next season.
